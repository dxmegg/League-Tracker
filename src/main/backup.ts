// missing every commit still sitting in the -wal: copying it produces a
// database that is stale at best and unopenable at worst.
//
// The copy runs a hundred pages at a time, returning to the event loop between
// steps, so a poll landing a game mid-backup doesn't block on it. That the
// backup is stepped rather than instantaneous is safe here because it reads
// through the same connection everything else writes on — SQLite applies those
// writes to the copy in flight instead of leaving it torn across versions.

// generously to reach back as far as it sounds like it does. Six monthly slots
// buy roughly half a year of horizon; three would have bought about three
// weeks, because the first two would be spent on months the weekly tier
// already covers. In steady use this settles at a dozen or so files.
